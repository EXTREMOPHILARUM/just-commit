# Interactive Rebase Tool Documentation

## Overview

The `features/interactive_rebase_tool.py` module provides assistance with interactive rebase operations in Git. This tool is designed to simplify the rebase process by visualizing the steps involved and suggesting commands to streamline the workflow.

## Visualizing Rebase

The tool includes a feature to visualize the rebase process, helping users understand the sequence of commits that will be affected. This visualization aids in planning the rebase strategy, such as deciding which commits to squash, reword, or reorder.

## Executing Rebase

The `execute_rebase` method allows users to execute a series of rebase commands. This method takes a list of commands as input and runs them sequentially, ensuring that the rebase process is carried out smoothly.

## Assisting with Rebase

The tool also offers assistance during the rebase process by suggesting commands based on the current state of the repository. For example, it can suggest squashing similar commits or rewording commit messages for clarity.

## Examples

### Visualizing a Rebase

```python
rebase_tool = InteractiveRebaseTool()
rebase_tool.visualize_rebase()
```

This example demonstrates how to visualize the rebase process before executing any commands.

### Executing a Rebase

```python
commands = ['git rebase -i HEAD~3']
rebase_tool.execute_rebase(commands)
```

In this example, the tool executes an interactive rebase for the last three commits.

### Assisting with Rebase

```python
rebase_tool.assist_with_rebase()
```

This example shows how the tool can provide assistance and suggest commands during the rebase process.

## Conclusion

The Interactive Rebase Tool is a valuable addition to the Git workflow, making interactive rebases more intuitive and less error-prone. By visualizing, executing, and assisting with the rebase process, it helps users manage their commit history more effectively.
