# Enhanced Diff Documentation

## Overview

The `features/enhanced_diff.py` module provides an enhanced diff functionality for viewing changes between files. This feature is particularly useful for developers who need a more detailed view of code changes than what is provided by the default git diff.

## How It Works

The Enhanced Diff feature uses the `difflib` library to generate a unified diff between two sets of lines. It then utilizes the `pygments` library to syntax-highlight the diff output, making it easier to read and understand.

## Usage

To use the Enhanced Diff feature, you need to provide the paths to the two files you want to compare, along with their respective sets of lines. Here is an example of how to use it:

```python
from features.enhanced_diff import EnhancedDiff

from_lines = ['This is a test.', 'This part of the document has remained unchanged.', 'This is another test.']
to_lines = ['This is a test.', 'This part has been modified.', 'This is another test.']
diff = EnhancedDiff('example.txt', from_lines, to_lines)
diff.display()
```

This will output a syntax-highlighted diff showing the changes between `from_lines` and `to_lines`.

## Examples

Here are some examples of enhanced diffs:

- Example 1: Showing a simple change in a text.
- Example 2: Highlighting added and removed lines in a code snippet.

(Note: Actual diff outputs are not included here due to their dynamic nature.)

## Conclusion

The Enhanced Diff feature is a powerful tool for developers, making it easier to visualize changes between different versions of files. By providing a syntax-highlighted, unified diff, it enhances the code review process and aids in understanding code changes.
