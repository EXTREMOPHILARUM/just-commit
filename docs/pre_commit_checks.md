# Pre-commit Checks Documentation

## Overview

The `features/pre_commit_checks.py` module is designed to enforce code standards and run tests before commits are made to the repository. This ensures that all committed code adheres to the project's coding standards and passes all necessary tests, maintaining the codebase's integrity and quality.

## Pre-commit Checks Performed

The following checks are performed by the `pre_commit_checks.py` script:

- **Code Standards Check**: This check runs `flake8` to ensure that the code adheres to the project's coding standards.
- **Unit Tests**: This check runs `pytest` to execute all unit tests, ensuring that new changes do not break existing functionality.

## Example of Failed Checks

When a pre-commit check fails, the script outputs the name of the failed check along with the corresponding error messages. Here is an example of a failed Code Standards Check:

```
Running Code Standards Check...
Code Standards Check failed:
error: failed to run flake8
```

Similarly, a failed Unit Tests check might output:

```
Running Unit Tests...
Unit Tests failed:
error: failed to run pytest
```

## Integration with Git

The pre-commit checks are intended to be integrated with Git's pre-commit hooks. This means that the checks are automatically run every time a commit is attempted. If any check fails, the commit is aborted, and the errors must be resolved before the commit can be retried.

## Conclusion

Integrating pre-commit checks into your development workflow can significantly improve the quality and reliability of your codebase. By enforcing code standards and running tests before each commit, you can catch and fix issues early in the development process.
