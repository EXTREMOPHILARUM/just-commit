# Enhanced Merge Tool Documentation

## Overview

The `features/enhanced_merge_tool.py` module provides an advanced conflict resolution process for Git merge operations. This tool is designed to simplify the process of resolving merge conflicts, making it easier for developers to integrate changes from different branches.

## Conflict Resolution Process

When a merge conflict occurs, the Enhanced Merge Tool fetches the list of conflicted files and provides a detailed view of the conflicts. It then guides the user through the resolution process, offering suggestions for common conflicts and applying best practices for conflict resolution.

### Fetching Conflicted Files

The tool uses the `git diff` command to identify files with unresolved merge conflicts. It lists these files for the user, allowing them to focus on resolving conflicts one file at a time.

### Resolving Conflicts

For each conflicted file, the tool provides a side-by-side comparison of the conflicting changes. Users can then choose how to resolve each conflict, either by selecting one of the changes or manually editing the file to merge the changes.

### Integration with Git

Once conflicts are resolved, the tool integrates seamlessly with Git, marking files as resolved and continuing the merge process. This ensures that the merge operation is completed successfully, with all conflicts resolved.

## Usage Examples

- **Resolving a simple conflict**: The tool identifies a conflict in `example_file.py` and presents the conflicting changes. The user selects one of the changes, and the tool marks the conflict as resolved.
- **Manually resolving a complex conflict**: For complex conflicts, the user can manually edit the conflicted file, combining changes as needed. The tool then verifies the resolution and marks the file as resolved.

## Conclusion

The Enhanced Merge Tool is a valuable addition to the Git workflow, streamlining the conflict resolution process. By providing clear guidance and integrating directly with Git, it helps developers resolve merge conflicts more efficiently and with greater confidence.
