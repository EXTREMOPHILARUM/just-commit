# Backup and Recovery Documentation

## Overview

The `features/backup_recovery.py` module provides functionality for backing up and recovering the repository. This document outlines how to use these features to ensure data integrity and recoverability.

## Backup Process

To create a backup of the repository, the `backup_repository` method is used. It generates a git bundle of the entire repository and saves it to a specified backup directory with a timestamp.

### Usage Example

```python
from features.backup_recovery import BackupRecovery

backup_recovery = BackupRecovery()
backup_recovery.backup_repository()
```

This code snippet will create a backup of the repository in the default backup directory (`backups`) with a filename that includes the current timestamp.

## Recovery Process

To recover a repository from a backup, the `recover_repository` method is used. It clones the repository from the specified backup file into a recovery directory.

### Usage Example

```python
from features.backup_recovery import BackupRecovery

backup_recovery = BackupRecovery()
backup_recovery.recover_repository('backups/backup-20210101-120000')
```

This code snippet will recover the repository from the specified backup file into a directory named `recovery`.

## Integration Guidelines

To integrate the backup and recovery features into your workflow, consider automating the backup process at regular intervals or before significant changes. For recovery, ensure that team members are familiar with the recovery process and have access to the backup files.

## Conclusion

The backup and recovery features provided by `features/backup_recovery.py` are essential for maintaining the integrity and recoverability of your repository. By following the usage examples and integration guidelines, you can effectively safeguard your data.
