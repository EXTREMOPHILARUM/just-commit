# Visual Git Status Documentation

The `VisualGitStatus` feature provides a graphical representation of the current status of the git repository, making it easier to understand the state of your project at a glance. This feature is part of the Just Commit suite, designed to enhance the git command line experience.

## Overview

`VisualGitStatus` utilizes the `git status --porcelain` command to fetch the current status of the repository and then categorizes the files into staged, unstaged, and untracked. It then uses matplotlib to generate a pie chart visualizing the proportion of files in each category.

## Usage

To use the `VisualGitStatus` feature, ensure you have matplotlib installed in your environment. Then, simply run the `visual_git_status.py` script from the root of your git repository. The script will display a pie chart with the current status of your repository.

## Example Output

Below is an example of the visual output generated by `VisualGitStatus`. Note that the actual output will vary based on the current state of your repository.

This pie chart provides a quick and intuitive way to assess the state of your repository, showing the distribution of staged, unstaged, and untracked files.

## Source Code Reference
